#  Coding Practice  

Welcome to my little coding gym.  
This repo is just me logging consistency — from `hello world` to less dumb stuff.  

##  Why this repo?  
- Track my learning progress  
- Build coding discipline  
- Show consistency (not perfection)  

##  What’s inside?  
- **C basics** → print, loops, conditionals  
- **Future stuff** → Python, DS, Algo, whatever I touch next  

##  Note  
Not a project repo. Just raw practice & grind.
